Decision:
1, master branch equal to stable branch
2, testing branch equal to beta branch (find bugs)
3, testing-* branch equal to alpha branch (adding new function or changing structure)
4, the statement above isn't the rules, these statement just let you know what these branch means
	Example, last time I rebuild (nearly) whole script set in testing branch, this isn't satisfy these statement
